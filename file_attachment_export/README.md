# SUMMARY

This application will download all of the file attachments
connected to contacts (not emails, or company files)
and puts all of those files into a ZIP file.

The ZIP file will also have a "files.csv" which will outline
all of the other details about the files, including who they were
attached to, by contact ID

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Set the appname and API key in 'file_attachment_export.py'
2. Run in terminal
3. Zip file is placed in the 'output/' folder.
